_**FAQ**_

_**Can I use this portable launcher to play Minecraft Dungeons?**_

Sort of. The host computer still may need UE4 Prerequisites, but try it first, and see. I haven't tested Dungeons too much yet.

_**How do I update the Minecraft Launcher?**_

Just like usual! Just make sure you start with the batch file and not the Minecraft.exe file

_**Are there any viruses?**_

Absolutely not. The launcher was downloaded by me directly from Minecraft.net
